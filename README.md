# Card employee manager

## Disclamer

In windows terminal (cmd) instead of `python3` write `python`!

## Usage

Program is divided into two parts: manager client and terminal
client. 

### Manager

Manager client 'manages' whole system, modifies 
various entries in database and allows to add new employees,
terminals, cards.

#### manager.py usage

Open terminal in main directory of project and invoke command:

`python3 manage.py -h`

This will return you basic info how to use this program

For example to add new employee with
name Grzegorz Kowalski write:

`python3 manage.py add -e Grzegorz Kowalski`

Commands to invoke:

`add [-h] [-e Name Surname] [-t terminalID] [-c cardID]`

`delete [-h] [-e employeeID] [-t terminalID] [-c cardID]`

`list [-h] {employees,incidents,days,terminals,cards}`

`raport [-h] employeeID`

`assign [-h] cardID employeeID`

`unassign [-h] cardID`


### Terminal

Used to emulate physical terminal and read card from employees, and log info to system

#### terminal.py usage

 and invoke command:

1. Open terminal in main directory of project
2. Invoke `python3 mqttBroker.py` (launches mqtt script which is used for managing connections between system and terminals)
3. Invoke `python3 terminal.py <put here number of desired terminal>`

In order to get basic help of terminal.py usage invoke: `python3 terminal.py -h`

There are two terminals available out of the box: __1__ and __2__

You can add other terminals via command 
`python3 manage.py add -t <terminalID to be added>`

In order to turn off terminal.py just write `exit`

In order to turn off mqttBroker.py press `ctrl + z`
